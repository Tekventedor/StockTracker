A bull market is a period of time in financial markets when the price of an asset or security is rising or is expected to rise. The term "bull market" is most often used to refer to the stock market but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, real estate, currencies, and commodities.

## Characteristics of a Bull Market

1. Rising Prices: The most obvious characteristic of a bull market is rising prices over an extended period.
2. Strong Economy: Bull markets often coincide with strong economic growth, low unemployment, and rising corporate profits.
3. High Investor Confidence: During bull markets, investors tend to be optimistic about the market's future performance.
4. High Trading Volume: Trading activity typically increases as more investors enter the market.

## How to Identify a Bull Market

While there's no official definition, a bull market is generally considered to be a 20% rise in stock prices from recent lows, sustained over a period of time. The opposite of a bull market is a bear market, which is characterized by falling prices and negative market sentiment.
